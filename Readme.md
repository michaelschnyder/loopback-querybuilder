Loopback QueryBuilder
=====================

This is a small litte sample project that shows how to use `System.Linq.ExpressionVisitor` to convert expressions in anything you desire. 
In my case, I wanted to convert expressions on a `Queryable` to be used on a rather strange Rest-Style backend called [Lookpback.io](https://loopback.io/). Their specification is partially specified on their [Online documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Where-filter.html). But it seems that their format is heavily inspired by [SailsJs/Waterline](http://waterlinejs.org/) and MongoDb. See sources for more details.

## Sample
```c#
var builder = new LookbackQueryBuilder<Car>();

var query = builder.Where(car => car.Id = 2);
// Result: { where: { id: 2 } }

var query = builder.Where(car => car.Id = 2 && car.Name == "Audi");
// Result: { where: { and: [ { id: 2 }, { name: 'Audi' } ] } }

var query = builder.Where(car => car.Name.Contains("au"));
// Result: { where: { name: { 'like': '%di%' } } }
```

## Supported Operations
The following operations are supported and covered by tests.

* Equals / ==
* And / &&
* Contains (only single / without AND combinations)

Other operations are currently not supported.
